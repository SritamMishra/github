## MONOTREE FRONTEND TASK:

Welcome to MonoTree — a next-gen gaming hub built with a futuristic design philosophy, immersive visuals, and seamless integrations.
This project is crafted to deliver a professional, elegant, and cyberpunk-inspired web experience that not only showcases my development skills but also pushes the boundaries of what a modern portfolio project can look like.

🚀 Features:

🎨 Futuristic & Vibrant UI — glowing gradients, neon hover effects, and smooth animations for an immersive user experience.

⚡ Fully Automatic Integrations — with Steam, Discord, Twitch, OBS, Battle.net, Epic Games, Riot, and Xbox.

🖥️ Responsive Design — optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

🧩 Scalable Structure — clean, modular code for easy expansion.

🔒 Authentication Ready — designed with professionalism in mind.

✨ Elegant Animations — scroll reveals and hover effects that impress judges, seniors, and recruiters.

🖼️ Preview:

🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML5 — structure

CSS3 — styling, gradients, animations

JavaScript — for interactivity & future enhancements

Assets — custom gaming logos (Steam, Discord, Twitch, OBS, Battle.net, Epic, Riot, Xbox)

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out:

MonoTree isn’t just another portfolio website — it’s a statement of vision, creativity, and technical craft.
It reflects my ability to:

Merge design with development.

Deliver futuristic aesthetics aligned with gaming culture.

Build projects that feel both professional and production-ready.

🏆 Closing Note :

This project is the result of independent exploration, late-night problem solving, and a drive to build something that feels futuristic and professional.  
MonoTree is more than just a website — it represents my ability to learn, adapt, and create experiences that stand out in any competitive setting.
